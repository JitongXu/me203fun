About half a year after the trophyless end of his impressive [6-year stay at Tottenham Hotspur](https://www.transfermarkt.us/toby-alderweireld/leistungsdatendetails/spieler/42710/verein/148){:target="_blank"} (2015-2021), center back Alderweireld offered an assist only 5 minutes into the game, and his side [**Al Duhail**](https://www.duhailsc.qa/ "a Qatar website"){:target="_blank"} overwhelmed Al Gharafa by a [5-1 win in the 50th Amir Cup Final in Qatar](https://www.sportsfule.com/2022/03/18/toby-alderweireld-provides-assist-and-wins-his-first-trophy-in-qatar-with-al-duhail-with-the-amir-cup/){:target="_blank"}. This remarkable event took place on March 18, 2022.

Continuing his style at former clubs, Alderweireld was committed to soccer and his family, and it is hardly possible to catch any gossips or wild rumors about him off the pitch. On the path to the Amir Cup trophy, the defender provided [1 goal and 2 assists in only 4 appearances](https://www.transfermarkt.us/toby-alderweireld/leistungsdatendetails/spieler/42710){:target="_blank"} for Al Duhail. The other 1 goal and 1 assist were during the [4-1 win against Al Sailiya](https://www.transfermarkt.us/al-duhail-sc_al-sailiya-sc/index/spielbericht/3756267){:target="_blank"} in the quater-finals. Besides, he played in [20 matches](https://www.transfermarkt.us/toby-alderweireld/leistungsdatendetails/spieler/42710){:target="_blank"} in the Qatar Stars League.

Despite the success, Alderweireld did not see Qatar as the final stop of his career. In July, 2022, he came back to Europe and [joined Royal Antwerp](https://www.90min.com/posts/toby-alderweireld-returns-to-europe-with-hometown-club-royal-antwerp){:target="_blank"}, the Belgium soccer club in his hometown.

It is surprising that a lot about the Belgian's life in the Middle East remains unknown on the Internet, and the media seem to always care more about why he chose to play for the Middle East club than how he played afterwards. If you are interested in the latter part, perhaps it is time to enjoy a [podcast by *433: The Home of Football*](https://shows.acast.com/the-home-of-football-by-433/episodes/toby-alderweirelds-new-life-after-tottenham-hotspur){:target="_blank"} about Alderweireld's decision to leave the Premier League club and his life in Doha, Qatar.
