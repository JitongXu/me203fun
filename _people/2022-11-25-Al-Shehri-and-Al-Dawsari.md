On November 22, at Lusail Iconic Stadium, Saudi Arabia shocked the World Cup by a 2-1 comeback win over Argentina. Center forward Saleh Al-Shehri and left winger Salem Al-Dawsari were the two scorers who seized the opportunities from seemingly nowhere. Unlike [Mohammed Al-Owais](https://www.transfermarkt.us/mohammed-al-owais/leistungsdatendetails/spieler/262845){:target="blank"}, their goalkeeper teammate and the Player of the Match who have never played for a foreign club, the two players each have had a short spell in Europe.

29-year-old Saleh Al-Shehri joined Portuguese club [S.C. Beira-Mar](https://beiramar.pt/){:target="blank"} on loan for the 2012-13 season. He played in [11 matches]{:target="blank"} in all competitions for the club, with 2 goals in 7 matches in the Portuguese top-tier soccer division Liga Sagres. That was the only season in which he did not play for a Saudi Arabian club.

Salem Al-Dawsari is 31 years old now, and he actually caught some media's attention as [a notable player](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2018/jun/05/world-cup-2018-complete-guide-players-ratings-goals-caps?team=saudi-arabia&player=18){:target="blank"} in the Saudi Arabia squad before the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Perhaps in an effort to gain more experience and momentum, he [joined](https://www.transfermarkt.us/salem-al-dawsari/transfers/spieler/195332){:target="blank"} Spanish club Villarreal on loan in January 2018. But during that latter half of the 2017-18 season, his time in Spain may be far from fruitful, as he only made a 33-minute appearance in one formal match for the club. Nevertheless, this match may even look like a rehearsal from today's hindsight. In the final La Liga match of the season, Dawsari was substituted onto the pitch when Villarreal was down 0-2 at home against Real Madrid, and he [got involved](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/may/30/salem-al-dawsari-saudi-arabia-winger-world-cup-villarreal){:target="blank"} in Villarreal's first goal in the second half before the team finally leveled the score. In 2018, Al-Dawsari scored a late winner for Saudi Arabia to seize a sole win in that World Cup in the final group stage game [against Egypt](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12098/11416607/saudi-arabia-2-1-egypt-salem-al-dawsaris-injury-time-goal-hands-juan-antonio-pizzis-side-win){:target="blank"}. This year, even before the second group stage game against Poland, Saudi Arabia has already matched their last performance with respect to points with an even more thrilling win, and Al-Dawsari again is the one who scored the winning goal.
  
The 2022 Qatar World Cup is unique both in dates and places, and the Middle East teams and their talented players may continue to bring surprises to the audience.
