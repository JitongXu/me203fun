Xavier Hern치ndez Creus was born 25 January 1992 and was an former player who played an midfielder. 

People often call him ["one of the best midfielders"](https://sportsbrief.com/facts/bio/25246-who-xavi-hernandez-details-facts-greatest-midfielders-ever/){:target="_blank"}
because of his passing, vision, ball retention, and positioning.

He joined La Masia(FC Barcelona youth academy) when he was 11 years ago. Xavi has two eras at the FC Barcelona Coach . In his first era at the club, he achieved huge success and lasted 24 years so he was called ["an absolute legend at FC Barcelona"](https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/football/first-team/staff/2345156/xavi){:target="_blank"}.
In the second era, he became the coah and team manager for FC Barcelona in November 2021.

On 21 May 2015, he anounced he would join Al Sadd in Qatar and had a three year contract. In addition, [according to his agent](https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/32811382){:target="_blank"}, Ivan Corretja, "Xavi would also become an ambassador for the 2022 World Cup to be held in the Gulf state, and look to start his coaching qualifications".

On 28 May 2019, Xavi became the manger of Al Sadd and had a three year contract. He helped the club achieve 
many achievements. 

Based on the Xavi's opinion, he thought ["Qatar has become home"] (https://www.workerswelfare.qa/en/news/xavi-qatars-world-cup-will-be-unique){:target="_blank"} for me becuase he witinessed its strong commitment towards culture, sports, and education. He believed the 2022 World Cup would become **A TRUE Soccer Party".
