Moving on to [**Al-Rayyan SC**](https://alrayyansc.qa/?lang=en "a Qatar website"){:target="_blank"} from middle-class Premier League side Everton after departure from the privilaged Real Madrid, James Rodriguez's journey to the Middle East has been broadly recognized by media as [a worse stage in his fall](https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/fall-james-rodriguez-qatar-switch-new-low-colombian-icon/o0rbnzaouorj10k4qd7z5gfda){:target="_blank"}. Nevertheless, the attacking midfield may have had quite a social life in the Gulf region. For instance, in April, 2022, he seemed to quite enjoy himself when his visit to a restaurant at Riyadh (the capital of Saudi Arabia) was [videoed](https://www.tiktok.com/@ebudiyebiri/video/7087273422190890242 "redirect to TikTok video"){:target="_blank"} by Turkish chef Ebubekir Ã‡akmak. The Columbian was served a [**Baklava**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baklava){:target="_blank"}, a famous Turkish dissert.

The sharp contrast is his absense from the pitch. For one reason or another, the 2014 World Cup Golden Boot winner had only played **14 matches** for the Qatari club out of the 33 they had during the entire [2021-22 season (September 2021 - April 2022)](https://www.transfermarkt.us/james-rodriguez/leistungsdaten/spieler/88103/plus/0?saison=2021){:target="_blank"}.

In the new season of 2022-23, Rodriguez's relationship with Al-Rayyan SC seems [further broken](https://www.archyde.com/james-rodriguez-smiles-as-al-rayyan-goes-to-the-bottom-of-the-table/){:target="_blank"} as the 30-year-old sought to return to a European league. Eventually, he [joined Olympiakos](https://www.espn.com/soccer/soccer-transfers/story/4747224/ex-real-madrid-star-james-rodriguez-joins-greek-champions-olympiakos){:target="_blank"} in Greece in September.
