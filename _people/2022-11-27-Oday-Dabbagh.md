Palestinian soccer may be a marginalized topic even when people talk about Middle East soccer. Though away from the mainstream spotlight, Palestinians do have their soccer leagues, the top of which is the [West Bank Premier League](https://au.soccerway.com/national/palestine/west-bank-league/20212022/regular-season/r62769/){:target="blank"}. However, few Palestinian players travel outside the Middle East region to play for a European club. In the summer of 2021, [Oday Dabbagh](https://www.transfermarkt.us/oday-dabbagh/profil/spieler/561217){:target="blank"} made a rare example by joining the Portuguese club FC Arouca as a free agent.

For the central forward who will turn 24 on December 3 this year, the ongoing career in Portugal is far from fruitless. Since the beginning of October, Dabbagh started or got substituted onto the pitch in 8 out of the 9 games that his team played. During his appearances in 3 Portuguese domestic competitions before the World Cup, the Palestinian scored twice, including a late equalizer that [rescued a point](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d9kJnaNnFg){:target="blank"} from FC Paços de Ferreira in Liga Portugal. 

Born in Jerusalem, Oday Dabbagh's giftedness has already been tested during his time [with the Palestine team and at clubs](https://www.footballpalestine.com/oday-dabbagh-stands-on-the-brink-of-global-superstardom/){:target="blank"}. Most notably, he was [reportedly](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1894516/sport){:target="blank"} a key player for Al-Arabi's successful title challenge in Kuwaiti Premier League in the 2020-21 season, as the top scorer of the season with 13 goals. When the news came that Dabbagh would continue his career in Portugal, Ante Miše, the Croatian soccer manager of Al-Arabi who also previously worked with the Croatian national team, claimed that Dabbagh is [the best striker he has seen](https://www.arabnews.com/node/1894516/sport){:target="blank"}.

*It is worth mentioning why Dabbagh's 2022-23 season started in October instead of August. As soccer is never away from politics, Dabbagh's career has also reflected the subtle relation between Israel and Palestine. As a player from East Jerusalem, Dabbagh was faced with the same dilemma as [many Palestinian residents in this area](https://www.jpost.com/jerusalem/the-israelization-of-east-jerusalem-552835){:target="blank"} when it comes to travelling abroad: [They do not have Israel citizenship, and neither do they have Palestinian passorts](https://www.babagol.net/blog/2022/8/11/israel-palestine-tensions-have-growing-impact-on-football) on this territory [occupied by Israel in 1967](https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/313615_ISRAEL-2021-HUMAN-RIGHTS-REPORT.pdf){:referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="blank"}. In this way, they have to [apply for](https://www.gov.il/en/service/request_for_israeli_biometric_travel_document){:referrerpolicy="no-referrer" target="blank"} a travel document named **laissez-passer** from the Israeli government. His absence from the club's pre-season matches and quite a few formal matches at the beginning of the season was [reported](https://www.babagol.net/blog/2022/8/11/israel-palestine-tensions-have-growing-impact-on-football){:target="blank"} to be due to a prolonged wait for visa to enter the country, despite that it does not appear to be too troublesome.*
