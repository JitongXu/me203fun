The year 2022 has definitely been unusual for the "Iranian Messi". By the end of January, Azmoun has become [a member of **Leverkusen**](https://www.bayer04.de/en-us/player/werkself/bayer-04-leverkusen/sardar-azmoun "a German website"){:target="_blank"} in Germany. This transfer from Russian club Zenit St Petersburg took place half a year earlier than expected, and marked the halt of the striker's 10-year-long career period in Russia since his membership at [Rubin Kazan II](https://www.transfermarkt.com/rubin-kazan-ii/startseite/verein/11750/saison_id/2012){:target="_blank"}. Near the end of September, Azmoun [expressed support for Iranian women on Instagram](https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/sep/28/iran-footballers-show-solidarity-with-protests-over-mahsa-amini-death){:target="_blank"}, which was [echoed by Bayern Munich fans](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-11269425/Bayern-Munich-fans-express-solidarity-Iranian-protesters-Bayer-Leverkusens-Sardar-Azmoun.html){:target="_blank"} during the first Bundesliga match after the international break where the hosts Bayern Munich beat Leverkusen [4-0](https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/638507){:target="_blank"}.

*According to [theScore](https://www.thescore.com/deu_fed/news/2435026){:target="_blank"}, one of those banners on the Allianz Arena stand read "**Women, Life, Freedom**" in Farci, the Persian language. This is [the slogan of the protests in Iran](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/01/women-life-liberty-iranian-civil-rights-protests-spread-worldwide){:target="_blank"}.

Born on the first day of 1995, Azmoun has his height and scoring efficiency [comparable to former Bayern Munich forward Lewandowski](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/who-is-sardar-azmoun-bayer-leverkusen-iranian-messi-zenit-st-petersburg-18659){:target="_blank"}. According to [the analysis by BreakingTheLines](https://breakingthelines.com/player-analysis/player-analysis-sardar-azmoun/){:target="_blank"} about the striker's performance at Zenit, Azmoun may not play comfortably in positions other the central forward, but his impressive shooting accuracy along with movement both in the air and on the ground makes him a powerful threat especially in the opponents' penalty box.

Still, it may turn out just like Bayer Leverkusen coach Gerardo Seoane [said back in March](https://www.tasnimnews.com/en/news/2022/03/12/2681014/azmoun-needs-time-to-adjust-life-in-germany-coach-says){:target="blank"}: the "Iranian Messi" needs time bring out his best form. As October has begun, the striker is still seeking a chance to score his first goal [in the current 2022-23 season](https://www.transfermarkt.us/sardar-azmoun/leistungsdatendetails/spieler/180337/plus/0?saison=2022&verein=&liga=&wettbewerb=L1&pos=&trainer_id=){:target="blank"}, while Leverkusen is still struggling for a second Bundesliga win since May.
